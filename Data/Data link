Iâ€™m currently working on data analysis projects using the [Global Cybersecurity Threats Dataset (2015-2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-cybersecurity-threats-2015-2024) from Kaggle. This project explores patterns in cyberattacks, malware, targeted industries, and affected countries with the goal of understanding and forecasting cybersecurity trends.
