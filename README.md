## 🚀 Project Details

I’m currently working on data analysis projects using the [Global Cybersecurity Threats Dataset (2015-2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-cybersecurity-threats-2015-2024) from Kaggle. This project explores patterns in cyberattacks, malware, targeted industries, and affected countries with the goal of understanding and forecasting cybersecurity trends.

### 🔎 Key Questions I'm Exploring
- What are the most common types of cyberattacks?
- How frequent and severe are cyberattacks over time?
- Which regions or countries are most targeted?
- What is the financial impact of cyberattacks by industry and region?
